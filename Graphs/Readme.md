# 🕸️ Graphs in Java — DSA Series

Welcome to the **Graphs** section of this DSA repository!  
This folder includes Java implementations of classic and advanced graph problems using **adjacency list/matrix**, **DFS**, **BFS**, **Dijkstra**, **Union-Find**, and more.

Graphs are powerful tools for modeling relationships — from maps to social networks.

## 🧠 Graph Concepts & Representations

| Concept                     | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Directed vs Undirected** | Edge direction matters in directed; not in undirected.       |
| **Weighted Graphs**        | Edges have weights (used in Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal).        |
| **Adjacency List**         | Space-efficient representation using HashMap or List.        |
| **Adjacency Matrix**       | 2D matrix where `matrix[i][j] = 1` if edge exists.           |
| **Visited Array/Set**      | Tracks visited nodes in traversals.                          |
