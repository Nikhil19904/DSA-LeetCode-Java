# ðŸ”¢ Dynamic Programming (DP) in Java â€” DSA Series

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming** section of this repository.  
DP is one of the most essential topics for coding interviews and problem-solving mastery.

This folder contains Java solutions to classic and advanced DP problems using **tabulation**, **memoization**, and **space optimization**.

## ðŸ§  What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems, solving each once, and storing their results.

Key Techniques:
- **Memoization (Top-Down)** â€” recursion + cache
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)** â€” iterative + DP array
- **Space Optimization** â€” reducing memory usage to O(1) or O(2*n)
