# ðŸ“š Stack in Java â€” DSA Series

This section covers one of the most fundamental and versatile data structures: **Stacks**.

Implemented in Java, this folder includes classic stack-based problems using arrays, `Stack<T>` from Java Collections, and custom stack classes.

## ðŸ§± What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.

> ðŸ¥ž Think of it like a stack of plates â€” you can only take the top one off.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Operations

| Operation    | Description                |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| `push(x)`    | Insert element `x` on top  |
| `pop()`      | Remove top element         |
| `peek()`     | View top element           |
| `isEmpty()`  | Check if the stack is empty|

Java offers a built-in class:  
```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
