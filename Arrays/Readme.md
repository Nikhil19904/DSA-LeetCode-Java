# ðŸ”¢ Arrays in Java â€” DSA Series

Welcome to the **Arrays** section of this repository.  
Arrays form the backbone of many algorithmic problems and are a fundamental data structure for efficient data storage and manipulation.

This folder contains Java solutions to classic and advanced array problems focusing on sorting, searching, sliding windows, prefix sums, and more.

## ðŸ§  What are Arrays?

An **Array** is a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.

Arrays allow **fast access** by index and are used extensively in solving problems involving sequences of elements.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts & Techniques

| Concept             | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Fixed Size          | Size defined at initialization                |
| Indexing            | Zero-based, constant time access               |
| Mutable             | Elements can be changed                         |
| Multi-dimensional   | 2D, 3D arrays for matrices, grids              |
